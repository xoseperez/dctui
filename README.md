# DCTUI - Docker Compose Terminal User Interface

This tool is meant to manage docker stacks defined in docker-compose.yml files. 

The tool leverages the possibility to add extra tags to docker-compose.yml files from Docker Compose version 3.4 onwards to define metadata about the services in a `x-dctui` tag on the compose file itself. Therefore, both the stack configuration and the metadata are in the same file.
